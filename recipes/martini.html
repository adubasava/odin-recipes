    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a small skillet over medium heat. 
            Add shallot and cook, stirring constantly, until softened, about 3 minutes. 
            Carefully pour 1 1/4 ounces gin into the skillet; remove skillet from heat.
        </li>  
        <li>Add cream cheese, blue cheese, sour cream, 
            and shallot mixture to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. 
            (Alternatively, add ingredients to a bowl and use a hand mixer). 
            Beat on medium-low until well combined. 
            Add 1 1/4 cup olives and 1 1/2 tablespoons brine to mixture and mix until just incorporated. 
            Stir in salt and pepper; transfer mixture to a serving bowl. 
            Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
        </li>    
        <li>Meanwhile, make the olive topping. Combine remaining olives with remaining olive oil, 
            gin, brine, and black pepper in a small bowl. Stir well and let stand until ready to serve.
        </li>  
        <li>Drain off some of the liquid, and spoon olive mixture onto dip. Serve with crackers or crostini.</li>
